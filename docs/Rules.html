<h2>Starting the Game:</h2>

<p>If you have never played WAR! before, you will be asked for your
name and your nation mark. You may use any name you wish, up to 14
characters long. This name will be used for your national leader
(your first hero) and will be shown on status displays. You do not
have to use your real name.

<p>Enter a single exclamation mark (!) in place of the name to try
for a different city.

<p>The nation mark is the letter you wish to be used to represent
your nation's cities and armies in the game. (Cities are uppercase,
armies are lowercase.)

<p>Next, you will be instructed to press a key to continue. When
you do, the following screen will appear:

<pre>

  City:  Verdant (Verdant)

  Welcome to Solomoriah's WAR!  Press ? for Help.
</pre>

<p>(Of course, your screen may show a different city, and you
probably will name your hero something other than Victor...)

<p>If you enter the game before the first turn update, you will
have your hero, your city, and one army. For each turn after the
first that passes before you enter the game, you will have an
additional army, up to the limit of militia production (usually
four or six). This ensures you will not be helpless if you enter
the game late.

<p>The map uses the following symbols:

<pre>
    . Plains     * Neutral City
    % Forest     ! Battle Zone
    # Hills
    ^ Mountains
</pre>

(Blank space represents water.) 

<h2>Playing WAR!</h2>

<p>Your first act upon entering the game will probably be to attack
a neutral city nearby. To do so you will need to move your army(s)
into the city.

<p>Note the pointer (-&gt;) beside the hero, Victor, on the screen
view above. You use the (j) and (k) keys to move the pointer down
or up. If you press the (space bar) a * will appear next to the
army the pointer is pointing at. (Pressing (space bar) again will
remove the *.) You may also press (*) to select all, or (/) to
unselect all.

<p>Once you have selected your armies, press (m) to move them. A
message will appear at the bottom of the screen, as follows:

<pre>
 Move Army          7 8 9      y k u    SPACE to Stop.
                    4   6  or  h   l
                    1 2 3      n j m
</pre>

The keys shown move your army stack in the corresponding direction.
Note that if any army you have marked can't make a move, the entire
stack can't. 

<p>Next to each army name in the screen view, you will see a pair
of numbers separated by a colon. The first number is the army's
maximum movement allowance, and the second is the amount remaining.
Note that different armies may have different costs for moving
through a given space. Some terrain types may be totally impassable
to a given army type; for instance, cavalry can't move through
mountains, and most armies can't cross water.

<p>When you reach the neutral city, note that it will cost 2
movement points to enter. (Entering a hostile city always costs 2
points; friendly cities always cost 1 point.) Once you have entered
you will see an exclamation point (!) indicating a battle zone. You
may not move armies out of a battle zone... so you should then just
press (space bar) to finish moving.

<p>You may stop an army or an army stack anywhere, not just in a
city; your remaining movement will still be available in that
case.

<p>When the turn update runs, all battles will be resolved. Note
that if you attack a player-owned city, and he has moved additional
armies into the city, the results may not be as you expect.

<p>The reason is, player commands are executed in random order. The
nation list is scrambled, then each nation's commands are executed,
followed by battles.

<p>For instance, say you and your neighbor, both players, go to
war. You attack, moving a large army stack into a poorly-defended
city. He expects this, and moves a large army stack into the same
city to defend it.

<p>If his commands execute first, there will be one large battle,
as your army stack confronts his. If your commands execute first,
you may capture his city, only to be crushed when his defensive
force arrives.

<p>Players may have as many as twelve armies in a friendly city.
However, no more than ten armies belonging to a given nation may be
in any other space, including an enemy city. Note also that cities
give a bonus to the combat ratings of friendly units (the defense
value).

<p>Heros also give a bonus to friendly units they are grouped with.
Only the most powerful hero in a stack grants the stack his bonus.
(Only one commander per group.)

<h2>Changing the View:</h2>

<p>The map shows your current group near the center; the cursor
will be on the exact spot. To move the "focus" to another group,
use the (n)ext and (p)revious commands.

<p>Pressing (n) for next moves the focus to the next group, in map
order, which you own. A group consists of a city and/or one or more
armies. All armies in the group will be displayed in the right-hand
column. Enemy army counts will be below your armies. If the focus
is on a city, the city name and owning nation will be below the map
display.

<p>Similarly, (p) for previous moves to the previous group in map
order. If there are no previous groups (or no more groups for
next), a message will appear.

<p>You may also press (N) or (P) (capitalized) to move to the very
last (for N) or very first (for P) group.

<h2>Viewing the Map:</h2>

<p>You may gain "recon" information about the map around any focus
position by entering (i)nformation mode. While in "info mode" you
may move the cursor around the screen, to any spot visible. Notice
that the focus remains in the same place.

<p>Information about the terrain and armies present in each spot
you move the cursor over is shown just above the info mode help
display, at the bottom of the screen.

<h2>Status Display:</h2>

<p>The (s)tatus display shows the names of all nations, their
rulers and nation marks, and a count of their currently owned
cities, armies, and heros. While in status display, you may use
(n)ext and (p)revious to view other pages, or press ESC to return
to the normal display.

<h2>Drafting Armies:</h2>

<p>Each city can produce as many as four different types of units.
Initially, each city is set up to produce the lowest-ranked unit
type it can produce. You can change this for friendly cities by
pressing for the armies command. The available unit types will be
shown, along with the time to produce in parenthesis. The current
type in production is also shown, along with the remaining time to
produce the unit.

<p>If you change unit production, you lose any time spent producing
a different type. For instance, if one of your cities is producing
Lt. Cavalry and needs four turns to produce a unit, and you have
only two turns left to produce, then changing unit types causes you
to lose the two turns you have spent already.

<p>Not all cities take the same time to produce the same unit type.
Some cities are better at producing certain types. Also, not all
cities produce the same types of armies.

<h2>Transporting Armies:</h2>

<p>Certain special army types have the ability to transport other
armies. For instance, a Navy unit can transport an entire stack of
armies over water spaces. There are units able to transport entire
stacks, single armies, or single heros.

<p>To use a transporting unit, simply select it along with the
units you wish to have transported. When you begin moving the
stack, the movement costs will be applied to the transporting army.
Armies being carried pay a cost of 1 point per space moved through
regardless of terrain type, and do not have to stop when they reach
0 movement (as long as the transporting army can still move).

<h2>Special Hero Rules:</h2>

<p>As previously noted, a hero adds a bonus to all units stacked
under him (or her). This bonus, called the Command value, varies
from hero to hero.

<p>Heros may make use of hero-transporting armies (such as
Hippogryffs) as noted above.

<p>When a hero joins your nation, he or she has the movement
capability (or costs) of the lowest-ranked unit produced in the
hero's home city. For most heros, this results in the hero moving
like Lt. Infantry. Elf heros, however, have regular Elf movement
(making it easier to move through forests).

<h2>Reading the News and Mail:</h2>

<p>You can read the News by pressing (R). The News consists of
information about recent battles (in capsule form), captured
cities, etc. of all nations.

<p>You can read your Mail by pressing (M). The results of your
military actions will be mailed to you in detail; also, you may
receive mail from other national leaders this way. To send Mail,
press (S). You may enter the name of the leader, or the word All to
post a message in the News.
