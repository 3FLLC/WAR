NOTE:  The following is the old todo list for the program development.
It is not current, but has been retained for historical purposes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things to Do:
	Army stat viewer
	WAR and WARANSI -- mail count message
	Implement Rogue nation (#27).
		-- Captured Rogue cities will rebel if left unoccupied.
		-- Rogue armies move one space per turn at random.  They
			are 30% likely to leave a Rogue city.
	Finish WARTOOL
		-- City editor
		-- Army editor
		-- Troop-type editor
		-- Moving city - cancellation message
    Improve Control File docs in manual.

Things Done:
	Update manuals
		-- IBMPC setting
		-- MAPCHARS setting
	Implement CONTROL.WAR
		-- Set ANSI vs. DIRECT mode here.
		-- Execute commands in EXECCTRL.C (using EXECSUPP.C
			exactly as the other EXEC*.C modules).
		-- Can change default game directory.
		-- Can specify alternate titlescreen file.
		-- Can specify values for IBMPC and MAPCHARS.
		-- If not found, options will be as in old WAR!.
		-- WAR programs should accept multiple arguments.  Each
			argument will be the name of a control file.
		-- ???
	True Cursor Optimization in ANSI version
	Implement WARTOOL
		-- Move cities
		-- Move armies
		-- Clear turns (empty the world)
	Hero desertion
		-- If hero's side in battle is overmatched, untested heros
			will desert if a roll of 1dTotal is less than or equal
			to 1/2 the other side's Ctot.  Deserters are 50% likely
			to join the other side, otherwise they disappear (or 
			become Rogues... see below).
	Verify hero desertion
	Un-comment conditions in hero desertion
	Fix capture message ... Indigo is NOT the capitol of Militia!
	Rogue stage 1 completed -- Nation 27 cities may be created
		-- Rogue cities have a ? nation mark.
		-- Rogue armies outside a Rogue city have a blank nation
			mark.
		-- Rogue cities are not considered neutral and may not
			be the capitol of a player nation.
		-- A Rogue city captured by a player may not be able to
			produce the full range of armies that the Rogue nation
			could produce in the city.
	Ship pickups from shore
		-- Allow ships to beach, as follows:
			If an army with water movement attempts to move from
			water to non-allowed terrain, movement is allowed at
			a cost of 2 times water movement cost.
	Alternate Title Screen file.
