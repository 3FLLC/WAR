Solomoriah's WAR! is an old (20 years!) wargame I wrote for use on a DOS BBS,
then updated for use on Coherent's Unix clone, and eventually on Linux.  It has
a crufty old BBS-compatible interface and simple turn-based gameplay.  Movement
is hidden; the order in which each turn plays out (i.e. Initiative) is random
each turn, so you never know if you're going to swoop in on the other guy, or
he's going to swoop in on you.

These programs are written in K&R C, with a small amount of code having been
updated slightly.  Later iterations of the program suite added some Python
scripts to assist with Linux BBS support.

Though this program has been around 20 years, version 4.4 is the first public
release.
